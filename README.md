# Mangroves & Climate Change: Code for the Paper

This repository contains the code and data for the paper:

DOI: [10.1088/2752-5295/adffa9](https://doi.org/10.1088/2752-5295/adffa9)

## Getting Started

A great starting point is the file `Code/999_Figures.r`. This script generates all the figures presented in the manuscript and supplementary materials. Readers can use this file to track back the origin of the data archives and the CSV files containing the source numbers used in the analyses and figures.

All data sources and intermediate files are referenced within the code, making it possible to trace the workflow from raw data to final figures.
